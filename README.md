Introduction
------------

The goal of this paper is to create a cloud strategy for Peak.ai, a startup British technology business. This research seeks to offer a thorough evaluation of Peak.ai's present IT infrastructure and make suggestions for utilising cloud solutions to strengthen their infrastructure. This paper will compare cloud and non-cloud solutions and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy for various components of Peak.ai's infrastructure.

Background of the Enterprise
----------------------------
Peak.ai is an innovative technology startup that is using artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the way organisations run. Peak.ai, an organisation that was founded in 2015 with the goal of utilising AI technologies to promote corporate growth, profitability, and sustainability, has swiftly become a market leader in the AI sector (peak.ai, 2023).
By putting engineers, data science teams, and business professionals together on a single platform, the company's main goal is to empower organisations to make data-driven decisions. Peak.ai helps businesses to alter their commercial decision-making processes and obtain a competitive advantage in today's quickly changing business environment by utilising cutting-edge AI technologies.
Peak.ai has prospered due to a strong dedication to developing an environment that values creativity and creative thought. The business has so far raised a sizeable sum of investment capital, including a notable Series C round spearheaded by SoftBank. With the help of this finance, Peak.ai has been able to grow its business and significantly improve its AI skills.
The team at Peak.ai has quickly expanded to over 200 brilliant people (peak.ai, 2023). The organisation now has offices spread across six different nations, giving it a truly worldwide presence. Major household names are among their outstanding list of clients, which attests to the importance and effectiveness of their AI solutions.
Peak.ai is a machine learning and retail specialist who is a recognised AWS Advanced Technology Partner. Additionally, they have received recognition as one of the Top 25 Best Mid-Sized Companies to Work For, underscoring their dedication to offering a first-rate working environment for their staff. Peak.ai is ready to keep transforming sectors and enabling businesses to succeed in the digital era thanks to its cutting-edge AI-driven approach and track record of success.
 
Current IT Setup 
----------------
As a forward-thinking technology firm, Peak.ai has invested in a robust IT infrastructure, enabling them to offer state-of-the-art AI solutions. Their current setup includes high-performance servers with cutting-edge processors, ample RAM, and specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs to support intensive AI algorithms. Popular open-source tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, along with proprietary in-house software, enhance their AI capabilities
Networking plays a vital role in Peak.ai's IT system, with a high-bandwidth network architecture facilitating quick data transfer and communication. To ensure security, they have integrated firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
However, the present IT infrastructure faces challenges. Managing vast amounts of data generated during AI model training is a major difficulty, straining computation and storage resources and leading to bottlenecks. Rigorous capacity planning and scalable storage options like distributed file systems or cloud-based object storage are essential to address this issue.
Another limitation lies in the reliance on on-premises infrastructure, which restricts scalability and flexibility. This makes it harder for Peak.ai to respond quickly to market demands and increases upfront expenses for hardware.
To overcome these constraints, Peak.ai plans to leverage cloud technologies to enhance their IT system. By migrating some infrastructure to the cloud, they can achieve greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. This shift will allow them to focus more on their core AI expertise and better serve their clients.
 
 
Recommendations-
----------------

Storage:
--------
Recommendation: Cloud Solution (IaaS or SaaS)
Cloud vs Non-Cloud Comparison:
Cloud: On-demand storage that is scalable, built-in redundancy, disaster recovery features, and usage-based cost optimisation.
Non-Cloud: Limited scalability, reliance on physical storage infrastructure, potential lack of redundancy, and potential incapacity for disaster recovery.
Justification: When opposed to non-cloud options, using cloud storage solutions like object storage or cloud-based file systems gives Peak.ai a number of advantages. They are able to manage the increasing volume of data generated by their AI models thanks to the scalability that cloud storage offers on demand. It also has built-in redundancy and disaster recovery features that guarantee the availability and durability of data. By utilising a cloud storage provider, organisations can avoid making substantial upfront expenditures in storage equipment and have access to usage-based cost optimisation (Wolfschwenger et al., 2020).

Networking:
-------------
Recommendation: Cloud Solution (IaaS or PaaS)
Cloud vs Non-Cloud Comparison:
Cloud: Load balancing, auto-scaling, worldwide availability, integrated security controls, and monitoring tools are all features of scalable and safe networking architecture.
Non-Cloud: dependence on in-house networking equipment, potential scalability issues, and security features.
Justification: Peak.ai's networking infrastructure is made scalable and safe by moving networking components to the cloud. For AI applications, cloud networking services provide capabilities like load balancing, auto-scaling, and worldwide availability to provide the best performance and uptime (Aslanpour et al., 2020).

Applications:
----------------
Recommendation: Hybrid Cloud Solution (Combination of on-premises and SaaS)
Cloud vs Non-Cloud Comparison:
Cloud: Scalability, automatic upgrades, specialised software, little upkeep requirements, and easy interaction.
 
Non-Cloud: Control over sensitive data, quick responses, potential scalability restrictions, and availability of specialised software.
Justification: Peak.ai's apps can profit from a hybrid cloud strategy. They can keep complete control over sensitive data and accomplish low-latency interactions by hosting some applications on-premises. As opposed to traditional non-cloud solutions, however, using Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions for non-core applications has a number of benefits. Specialised software is provided through SaaS solutions (Wulf et al., 2021).

 
Conclusion
----------
To sum up, for the small technology business Peak.ai, developing a cloud strategy is crucial to realising their full potential. For various components of their infrastructure, we compared cloud-based and non-cloud solutions, and we came up with recommendations that support their corporate objectives.
