## Introduction
_______________________
The goal of this paper is to create a cloud strategy for Peak.ai, a startup British technology business. This research seeks to offer a thorough evaluation of Peak.ai's present IT infrastructure and make suggestions for utilising cloud solutions to strengthen their infrastructure. This paper will compare cloud and non-cloud solutions and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy for various components of Peak.ai's infrastructure. 
Background of the Enterprise
Peak.ai is an innovative technology startup that is using artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the way organisations run. Peak.ai, an organisation that was founded in 2015 with the goal of utilising AI technologies to promote corporate growth, profitability, and sustainability, has swiftly become a market leader in the AI sector (peak.ai, 2023).
By putting engineers, data science teams, and business professionals together on a single platform, the company's main goal is to empower organisations to make data-driven decisions. Peak.ai helps businesses to alter their commercial decision-making processes and obtain a competitive advantage in today's quickly changing business environment by utilising cutting-edge AI technologies.
Peak.ai has prospered due to a strong dedication to developing an environment that values creativity and creative thought. The business has so far raised a sizeable sum of investment capital, including a notable Series C round spearheaded by SoftBank. With the help of this finance, Peak.ai has been able to grow its business and significantly improve its AI skills.
The team at Peak.ai has quickly expanded to over 200 brilliant people (peak.ai, 2023). The organisation now has offices spread across six different nations, giving it a truly worldwide presence. Major household names are among their outstanding list of clients, which attests to the importance and effectiveness of their AI solutions.
Peak.ai is a machine learning and retail specialist who is a recognised AWS Advanced Technology Partner. Additionally, they have received recognition as one of the Top 25 Best Mid-Sized Companies to Work For, underscoring their dedication to offering a first-rate working environment for their staff. Peak.ai is ready to keep transforming sectors and enabling businesses to succeed in the digital era thanks to its cutting-edge AI-driven approach and track record of success.
Current IT Setup
As a forward-thinking technology firm, Peak.ai has made investments in a solid and expandable IT infrastructure that allow them to provide their clients state-of-the-art AI solutions. Their current IT infrastructure consists of a mix of hardware, software, and networking elements that assist with their daily operations and encourage their creative work.
Peak.ai uses a range of high-performance servers and hardware-based computational resources. To support the intensive computing requirements of their AI algorithms, these servers include cutting-edge processors and lots of RAM. The business also makes use of specialised hardware accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to quicken the training and inference processes for their machine learning models.
This includes popular open-source tools with a solid framework for developing and using AI models, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch (Cardoso et al., 2022). The company uses proprietary software products that were developed in-house as well to enhance its AI capabilities and make client system integration simple.
Peak.ai's IT system relies heavily on networking to guarantee quick data transfer and communication. They have put in place a high-bandwidth network architecture that enables quick data transfer between various parts of their AI systems (peak.ai, 2023). To safeguard sensitive data and defend against potential threats, this network is outfitted with security mechanisms including firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Although Peak.ai's present IT infrastructure is reliable, it does have some restrictions and difficulties. The management of huge amounts of data produced during AI model training and inference is one of the main difficulties (Niknam et al., 2020). The processing and storing of this data may impose a burden on the available computation and storage resources, thereby causing bottlenecks and slower processing speeds. To meet this problem, rigorous capacity planning is necessary, as well as the deployment of scalable storage options such distributed file systems or cloud-based object storage.
Reliance on on-premises infrastructure, which may have scalability limitations and restricted flexibility, is another drawback. With an on-premises structure, moving operations to additional locations or scaling up computing capacity to meet peak demand may be more difficult. This restriction may make it more difficult for Peak.ai to react swiftly to market demands and could increase the up-front expenses of purchasing and maintaining hardware.
Peak.ai is aware of these constraints and difficulties and is attempting to use cloud technologies to improve their current IT system and get beyond these obstacles. They can gain from increased scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency by moving some of their infrastructure to the cloud, which will enable them to concentrate more on their core AI expertise and better serve their clients.
Existing VS Recommended Setup
Existing Software	New Software
TensorFlow	TensorFlow with Google Cloud AI Platform
PyTorch	PyTorch with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning
Proprietary in-house software	Customized cloud-based AI solutions
Distributed file systems	Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
On-premises infrastructure	Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azu
Justification for recommended system
Through the integration of TensorFlow with the Google Cloud AI Platform, Peak.ai is able to make advantage of the scalable and controlled infrastructure offered by Google Cloud. This paves the way for quicker deployment and maintenance of artificial intelligence models, as well as enhanced efficiency and access to additional resources.
Peak.ai is able to take use of the cloud capabilities that Azure provides for machine learning since it has PyTorch deployed on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. Integration with other Azure services, such as Azure Data Lake Storage, is also a part of this for the purpose of achieving effective data management.
Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions delivered through the cloud by Peak.ai may be modified to accommodate the requirements of every particular business. Because of this, it is possible that it will be essential to employ both free and commercial resources, making use of the scalability, flexibility, and reduced overhead costs offered by cloud computing.
Conventional distributed file systems might be replaced by cloud-based object storage services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage in the future thanks to Peak.ai. These systems provide trustworthy and scalable storage alternatives for the massive volumes of data that are produced during the training and inference phases of AI model development.
The migration of Peak.ai's infrastructure from on-premises to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure has provided the company with additional freedom to build new features and respond to changing conditions. They could be able to cut their initial spend on hardware, have access to a variety of AI-centric services, and increase or decrease their processing capacity in response to changes in the workload.
Conclusion
To sum up, for the small technology business Peak.ai, developing a cloud strategy is crucial to realising their full potential. For various components of their infrastructure, we compared cloud-based and non-cloud solutions, and we came up with recommendations that support their corporate objectives.
